summertemps
===========

D3 project exploring summertime temperatures from 2012 to 2013 in Columbia Missouri. 
Data sourced from NOAA weather station in sanborn field.

A first stab at using D3 to explore the wild variety between summer 2012 and summer 2013.  
Happy with the ability to switch between years and stack the temperatures numerically, 
version 2 will likely include notation of some sort on which days it rained, and perhaps a humidity index.
